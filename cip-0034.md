## Title: Lock Description OP
**Author:** JA  
**Discussions-To:** [https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/discussions/135](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/discussions/135)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Type:** Proposal  
**Created:** 2024-02-10  

## Abstract
This proposal suggests adding a new field to the issuances table to lock the description of assets, ensuring the immutability of the asset descriptions. This change aims to prevent asset owners from altering the metadata attached to an asset after its issuance.

## Motivation
Currently, there is no mechanism in place to prevent the alteration of data associated with an asset once it has been issued. With the proliferation of on-chain assets and the increasing value of historical assets, ensuring the immutability of asset data has become a critical necessity. Asset buyers often assume that the art or data attached to an asset is immutable, which is not always the case.

## Rationale
The perception of immutability is a key factor in the value and trust associated with on-chain assets. However, the reality is that asset owners can change the attached data, including descriptions and linked art, at any time. This undermines the trust and value placed in these assets. While transferring ownership of the asset to a burn address is a partial solution, it does not fully address the issue, as marketplaces begin to offer royalties to artists, incentivizing the retention of ownership.

## Specification
The implementation of this proposal would involve adding a `locked_description` field to the asset issuance table. This field would indicate whether the description of the asset is locked and immutable. Once an asset is issued with a locked description, any attempt to issue a new description for this asset would be invalidated by the Counterparty protocol. This ensures that once the description is locked, it cannot be altered, preserving the integrity and trust in the asset's metadata.

### Steps for Implementation:
1. **Database Schema Update**: Update the `issuances` table schema to include a `locked_description` boolean field.
2. **Protocol Modification**: Modify the asset issuance protocol to check the `locked_description` field. If the field is set to `true`, any subsequent attempts to alter the asset's description should be rejected.
3. **User Interface Adjustments**: Update any user interfaces, wallets, or marketplaces interfacing with Counterparty to allow users to set the `locked_description` field at the time of asset creation.
4. **Documentation and Guidelines**: Provide documentation for asset issuers on the implications of locking asset descriptions and guidelines on how to use this feature effectively.

## Backward Compatibility
This proposal is not backward compatible as it introduces a new field altering the existing structure or functionality of asset issuance. Assets issued prior to the implementation of this proposal would dont have the `locked_description` so they will be added to them if they lock the description, assets issued after the implementation of this porpossal have this field set to false by default unless in the issuance is explicit specified this field as true.
