This is the repository for Counterparty Improvement Proposals, also known as "CIPs". People wishing to submit CIPs, first should propose their idea or document on the [Counterparty CIP Discussions](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/discussions) github section. Many pre-draft discussions are also presented on the [Counterparty Developer Telegram](https://t.me/Counterparty_Dev). After discussion and copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here, normally as a pull request merge.

The CIP process will follow the [Counterparty Improvement Proposals (CIP) process](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0001.md) as closely as is reasonably possible. We are fairly liberal with approving CIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a CIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a CIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Counterparty users.
